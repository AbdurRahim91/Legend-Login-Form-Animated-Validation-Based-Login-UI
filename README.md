# Legend-Login-Form-Animated-Validation-Based-Login-UI

Floating icons using Font Awesome (e.g., user & lock)

Error message display when fields are empty

Button animation (evade effect) on hover if fields are incomplete

Responsive design – suitable for desktop and mobile

⚙️ Technology Used:
HTML5 – Structure of the form

CSS3 – Styling, dark theme, button transitions
